programming the AC control/driver board:

1.  Using an AVR programmer, such as an AVRISP MKii, plug it into the 2x3 pin connector (with a 0.1" x 0.1" pitch) on the board.  The red stripe on the ribbon wire goes with the
dot on the board.

using Atmel Studio (I use Atmel Studio 7), go to Tools -> Device Programming.  Under "Device", select ATTiny25.
Under the "Memories" tab, select the ATTiny .hex code under the "flash" label.  Then program the chip (click "program").  Don't do anything with the "EEProm" area.

2.  For the dsp30f4011 chip, plug in a pickit 3 into the 6 x 1 connector, with the dot on the board corresponding to the triangle on the pickit 3.  I use MPLAB IDE 8.83.  
If you also use that, click on File -> Import.  Then select the AC controller software .hex file.  Then go to Programmer -> Select Programmer -> Pickit 3.

Then, turn on the 24v power to the board, and then go to Programmer -> Program.
