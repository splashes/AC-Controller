Testing your newly soldered board:

Connect the 3 current sensors.

Jumper together J2/J3/J14, J7/J8/J15, and J11/J12/J4 (this disables the desaturation detection circuit, to allow the PWM to get through for testing)

Connect an AVRISP MKii (or some other avr programmer) to J41.  

Attach +24v to J38, and the 24v ground to J39.  
Program the ATTiny25 with DC-DC-Converter.hex.  You will need Atmel Studio, which is free, and something like an AVR isp mkii, or some other AVR programmer.
With power still attached, measure the voltage between each pair of back metal tabs of Q3/Q4, Q5/Q6, Q7/Q8, Q9/Q10, Q11/Q12, Q13/Q14.
You should get around 24v (+/-) for each measurement.  If you don't, check your soldering!
Disconnect 24v power.  Remove the AVRISP MKii.


Attach PICKit3.  
**Optional Extra step if you have MPLab installed, and can compile the AC controller software**
uncomment the line "#define DEBUG_MODE" in ACController.h.
Compile and program (in release mode) the dsPIC30F4011.  Measure the voltage from 0v to each of "GATE" across the top of the board. You should get around 3v each time.
Now, comment out the line "define DEBUG_MODE", so it looks like this:
// #define DEBUG_MODE
rather than
#define DEBUG_MODE
And then recompile the code and program the chip.  You are done!
**End of optional extra step**

Program the dsPIC30F4011 with the provided .hex file.  It will be called something like ACController.hex. Put the negative
probe of the volt meter on any of the test points across the top labeled 0v.  They are all connected right now because of the jumper wires you added.
With the positive lead of the volt meter, measure all the test points labeled "GATE". It should alternate -8v & 15v as you go left to right, measuring
"GATE" of all 6 isolated supplies.
