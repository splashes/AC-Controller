throttle configuration:

throttle fault < max regen < min regen < min positive torque < max positive torque

So, a possible configuration for a standard hall effect throttle would be:

throttle fault = 5
max regen = 50
min regen = 200
min positive torque = 250
max positive torque = 900

So, "zero torque command" is in 200-250.  Then, when you release the throttle completely, it might show 50 on the microcontroller, so you would get max regen until you come to a stop.
Full throttle would be around 900 (1023 would mean 5.0 volts for the analog signal).
