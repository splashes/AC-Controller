Notice the writing for the pinouts for the resolver board.  The 7 pin connector goes:

See the attached ResolverToEncoder17Pinout.pdf.

The following goes to the resolver:
GND (this is optional, but would be connected to the shield of a 7 pin shielded cable).
!EX 
EX 
SIN+ 
SIN-
COS-
COS+

The following goes to the control/driver board:
+24v
+5v
GND
QEA
QEB
I (this is short of index)

On the control/driver board, see the pinout attached.  The view of the ACControlDriver26Pinout.pdf is of the top of the board, which is the surface mount components.  See the 6 connections on that board called:
Encoder +24v
Encoder +5v
Encoder GND
Encoder QEA
Encoder QEB
Encoder INDEX

Those pins go to the resolver to encoder board's 6 pin connector.
